# Controls Required for SOE Phishing Attack Scenario

## Overview
To mitigate the risks identified in the phishing attack scenario targeting SOE, a desktop application used in dentistry, the following security controls are required. These measures aim to prevent unauthorized access, reduce vulnerabilities, and strengthen the overall security posture of the SOE application and its desktop environment.

## Controls Required:

1. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Perform routine security audits of the SOE desktop application and its underlying operating systems.
   - Ensure vulnerabilities in desktop configurations and application updates are identified and resolved.
   - Verify compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR.

2. **Patch Management**:
   - Establish a robust patch management system for the SOE application and operating systems to keep them up-to-date.
   - Address critical vulnerabilities promptly, especially those that could be exploited via phishing attacks.

3. **Employee Training on Phishing Awareness**:
   - Educate users on identifying phishing emails and malicious links to prevent inadvertent credential compromise.
   - Conduct simulated phishing campaigns tailored to SOE-specific workflows to enhance employee readiness.

4. **Endpoint Protection**:
   - Deploy endpoint security tools such as antivirus, anti-malware, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions on desktops running the SOE application.
   - Enable real-time threat detection and response capabilities to mitigate risks from downloaded malware.

5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Implement MFA for user logins to the SOE application, ensuring secure access to sensitive patient data.
   - Use desktop-compatible MFA methods, such as hardware tokens or app-based authentication.

6. **Network Traffic Monitoring**:
   - Monitor network traffic from desktops running SOE to identify unusual patterns or suspicious communications.
   - Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block potential threats.

7. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Apply RBAC policies within the SOE application to limit access to patient data and sensitive functionalities.
   - Regularly review and adjust user permissions to follow the principle of least privilege.

## Implementation Notes:
- Controls must account for the desktop-specific nature of SOE and its integration into the local IT environment.
- Security solutions should not disrupt the application’s usability for dental practice staff.
- Regular testing and updates are critical to adapting to new threats targeting desktop applications.
