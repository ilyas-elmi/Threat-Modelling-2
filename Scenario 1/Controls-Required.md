# Controls Required for SOE Phishing Attack Scenario

## Overview
To mitigate the risks identified in the phishing attack scenario targeting the SOE system, the following security controls are required. These measures aim to prevent unauthorized access, reduce vulnerabilities, and strengthen the overall security posture of the SOE application and its infrastructure.

## Controls Required:

1. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct periodic audits of the SOE application and underlying infrastructure.
   - Identify vulnerabilities in software configurations, third-party dependencies, and access controls.
   - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR.

2. **Patch Management**:
   - Implement a robust patch management process to ensure the SOE system is up-to-date with security patches and updates.
   - Focus on addressing critical vulnerabilities in the application and operating systems.

3. **Employee Training on Phishing Awareness**:
   - Conduct regular training sessions for SOE users to help them identify and avoid phishing attempts.
   - Provide simulated phishing exercises to measure and improve user awareness.

4. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
   - Deploy a WAF to monitor and filter incoming traffic to the SOE application.
   - Block malicious requests such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other web-based attacks.

5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Enforce MFA for all user accounts, including administrators, to enhance login security.
   - Ensure MFA implementation uses secure methods such as time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) or hardware tokens.

6. **Network Traffic Monitoring**:
   - Enable continuous monitoring of network traffic for unusual patterns and suspicious activities.
   - Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect and respond to potential threats in real-time.

7. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Implement RBAC policies to restrict access to sensitive patient data based on user roles.
   - Regularly review and update permissions to ensure compliance with the principle of least privilege.

## Implementation Notes:
- Each control should be tailored to the SOE application's specific architecture and user workflows.
- Controls should be tested regularly to ensure effectiveness and alignment with evolving threats.
