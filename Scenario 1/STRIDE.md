# STRIDE Analysis for SOE Phishing Attack Scenario

## Introduction
The STRIDE framework identifies and categorizes potential threats to a system. This analysis applies STRIDE to evaluate risks posed by phishing attacks targeting the SOE desktop application and its infrastructure.

---

## Threat Categories

### 1. Spoofing
- **Description**: Attackers spoof SOE system emails to impersonate legitimate communications.
- **Risk**:
  - Users may believe the phishing email is genuine and interact with malicious links or attachments.
- **Countermeasures**:
  - Implement email authentication mechanisms such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
  - Train users to recognize spoofed emails.

### 2. Tampering
- **Description**: Attackers tamper with patient data or system configuration files after gaining access.
- **Risk**:
  - Altered records may lead to incorrect patient treatment or legal repercussions.
- **Countermeasures**:
  - Enable file integrity monitoring on critical data and application files.
  - Log all modifications to patient data.

### 3. Repudiation
- **Description**: Lack of logging allows attackers to deny actions or evade detection.
- **Risk**:
  - Attackers may hide traces of malicious activity, complicating forensic analysis.
- **Countermeasures**:
  - Ensure all user actions and application events are logged.
  - Use tamper-proof logging mechanisms.

### 4. Information Disclosure
- **Description**: Unauthorized access to sensitive patient information.
- **Risk**:
  - Data breaches could expose patient PII and medical records.
- **Countermeasures**:
  - Encrypt patient data at rest and in transit.
  - Implement strong access controls such as RBAC.

### 5. Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Description**: Attackers disrupt SOE functionality, preventing dental practices from operating.
- **Risk**:
  - Operational downtime leads to financial losses and reputational damage.
- **Countermeasures**:
  - Deploy rate-limiting mechanisms and monitor for unusual traffic patterns.
  - Use anti-malware tools to block ransomware attempts.

### 6. Elevation of Privilege
- **Description**: Stolen credentials provide attackers with unauthorized access to privileged accounts.
- **Risk**:
  - Attackers gain administrative access, enabling system-wide control.
- **Countermeasures**:
  - Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.
  - Regularly review and limit administrative account access.

## Recommendations
1. Conduct regular security audits focusing on STRIDE threat categories.
2. Implement security awareness training to reduce susceptibility to phishing.
3. Deploy endpoint protection and monitor desktop application activity for anomalies.
4. Strengthen authentication mechanisms to prevent credential misuse.
5. Encrypt all sensitive patient data and maintain robust access controls.
