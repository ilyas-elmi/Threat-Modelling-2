# STRIDE Analysis for Insider Attack

## Introduction
The STRIDE framework helps identify and mitigate threats posed by insider attacks. This analysis focuses on insider misuse of authorized access to compromise sensitive patient data stored in the SOE system.

---

## Threat Categories

### 1. **Spoofing**
- **Description**: Insiders may use shared or stolen credentials to impersonate other users within the SOE application.
- **Impact**:
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive patient records under another userâ€™s identity.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users.
  - Regularly rotate credentials and prohibit shared account use.

---

### 2. **Tampering**
- **Description**: Insiders may manipulate or delete patient records to disrupt operations or cover malicious actions.
- **Impact**:
  - Altered records can harm patient care and lead to legal liability.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit data modification rights.
  - Enable logging and monitoring for all data modifications.

---

### 3. **Repudiation**
- **Description**: Insiders may deny malicious actions, such as data access or tampering, due to insufficient logging or monitoring.
- **Impact**:
  - Lack of accountability hinders incident response and forensic investigations.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use tamper-proof logs and implement real-time monitoring of user activity.
  - Require dual approval for high-risk operations, such as data exports or mass deletions.

---

### 4. **Information Disclosure**
- **Description**: Insiders exfiltrate sensitive patient data to external devices or networks.
- **Impact**:
  - Violations of GDPR or HIPAA result in financial penalties and reputational harm.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Deploy Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions to monitor and block unauthorized data transfers.
  - Encrypt sensitive patient data at rest and in transit.

---

### 5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
- **Description**: Insiders disrupt operations by deleting or corrupting critical data within the SOE system.
- **Impact**:
  - Operational downtime affects service delivery and patient care.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Maintain regular database backups and test disaster recovery plans.
  - Monitor for abnormal activity patterns, such as bulk data deletions.

---

### 6. **Elevation of Privilege**
- **Description**: Insiders create unauthorized admin accounts to gain elevated access to the SOE system.
- **Impact**:
  - Attackers gain control over sensitive records and operational data.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Regularly audit admin accounts and enforce MFA for all privileged users.
  - Use behavior analytics to detect anomalies in privilege escalation.

---

## Recommendations
1. **Access Control**:
   - Enforce least-privilege access policies through RBAC and regular access reviews.
2. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging and real-time alerts for high-risk activities.
3. **Data Encryption**:
   - Protect sensitive data with encryption to prevent misuse after exfiltration.
4. **Employee Awareness**:
   - Train staff on acceptable use policies and encourage reporting of suspicious behaviors.
5. **DLP Implementation**:
   - Deploy tools to block unauthorized data exports and monitor for insider threats.
