# Controls Required for Insider Attack Scenario

## Overview
To mitigate the risks posed by insider threats, a combination of technical, administrative, and procedural controls is essential. These measures focus on limiting access, monitoring user behavior, and creating a culture of security awareness.

---

## Technical Controls

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Assign the least-privilege access necessary for each role.
   - Regularly review user roles and permissions to ensure they align with job responsibilities.
   - Disable accounts immediately upon employee termination or role change.

2. **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring**
   - Log all user activity within the SOE application, including data access, exports, and modifications.
   - Monitor for anomalous behaviors such as:
     - Accessing data outside of working hours.
     - Bulk data exports.
     - High-frequency queries.
   - Implement alerts for high-risk activities.

3. **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**
   - Deploy DLP solutions to monitor and block:
     - Unauthorized transfers of data to USB drives or external storage.
     - Use of unauthorized file-sharing platforms.
   - Flag attempts to exfiltrate large amounts of data.

4. **Behavioral Analytics**
   - Use User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) tools to detect unusual activity patterns, such as:
     - Excessive queries to sensitive patient data.
     - Access to data not typically used by the individualâ€™s role.

5. **Encryption**
   - Encrypt all sensitive patient data at rest and in transit.
   - Ensure backups are encrypted to prevent misuse if accessed.

6. **Endpoint Protection**
   - Install endpoint monitoring tools on SOE workstations to detect unauthorized software or scripts.
   - Restrict the use of external devices like USB drives unless explicitly authorized.

## Administrative Controls

1. **Insider Threat Awareness Training**
   - Educate employees about the risks and signs of insider threats.
   - Encourage the reporting of suspicious behaviors through anonymous channels.

2. **Background Checks**
   - Conduct thorough background checks for employees, contractors, and third-party vendors with access to sensitive data.
   - Reassess access privileges during role changes or after behavioral concerns.

3. **Clear Access Policies**
   - Document and enforce strict policies on data access, handling, and export.
   - Regularly communicate policies to employees.

---

## Procedural Controls

1. **Regular Audits**
   - Perform routine audits of user activity logs to detect insider threats.
   - Include access reviews for critical systems and databases.

2. **Separation of Duties**
   - Divide responsibilities among multiple users to prevent a single point of failure or abuse of access.
   - Require dual approval for sensitive operations, such as exporting patient data or modifying records.

3. **Incident Response Plan**
   - Develop and regularly test an incident response plan for insider threats.
   - Include procedures for investigating and mitigating insider-related incidents.

## Implementation Notes
- Combine proactive (e.g., RBAC, DLP) and reactive (e.g., monitoring, incident response) measures.
- Ensure that controls balance security with operational efficiency to avoid unnecessary friction.
- Align controls with compliance requirements like GDPR and HIPAA.
