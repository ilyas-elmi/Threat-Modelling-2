# Controls Required for SQL Injection Attack

## Input Validation and Sanitization
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Enforce strict input validation, rejecting unexpected characters (e.g., `';--`).

## Database Security Hardening
- Restrict database permissions based on user roles (least privilege).
- Regularly audit database configurations and logs to identify anomalies.
- Enable database triggers to monitor and block destructive queries.

## Application Hardening
- Secure the SOE application to sanitize all inputs before they reach the database.
- Encrypt communications between the SOE desktop application and backend.

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious traffic targeting SQL vulnerabilities.

## Monitoring and Logging
- Monitor database logs for unusual query patterns.
- Set up real-time alerts for potentially destructive commands (e.g., DROP, ALTER).

## Training and Awareness
- Train developers to avoid unsafe coding practices, such as string concatenation in SQL queries.
- Educate dental staff to report unexpected SOE behavior promptly.

## Patch Management
- Apply patches and updates to the SOE desktop application and database to fix known vulnerabilities.
