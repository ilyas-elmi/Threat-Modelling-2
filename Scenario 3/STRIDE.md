# STRIDE Analysis for SQL Injection Attack

## Introduction
The STRIDE framework categorizes threats that arise during SQL injection attacks targeting the SOE desktop application and its backend database. This analysis identifies potential risks and suggests mitigations for each threat category.

---

## Threat Categories

### 1. **Spoofing**
- **Description**: Attackers exploit input fields to impersonate legitimate users or bypass authentication.
- **Impact**:
  - Unauthorized access to SOE accounts and sensitive patient data.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
  - Implement strong authentication mechanisms, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

---

### 2. **Tampering**
- **Description**: Attackers manipulate patient data or database records using malicious SQL commands.
- **Impact**:
  - Altered or deleted records disrupt operations and could lead to incorrect treatments or legal issues.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Restrict database permissions based on user roles (least privilege principle).
  - Enable database triggers to detect and block tampering attempts.

---

### 3. **Repudiation**
- **Description**: Lack of sufficient logging allows attackers to deny malicious actions, such as data manipulation or exfiltration.
- **Impact**:
  - Difficulties in tracing the source of unauthorized actions during forensic investigations.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement tamper-proof logging for all database queries and modifications.
  - Set up real-time monitoring and alerts for suspicious activities.

---

### 4. **Information Disclosure**
- **Description**: SQL injection exposes sensitive patient data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and medical records.
- **Impact**:
  - Violations of privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and reputational damage.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
  - Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive fields.
  - Audit database queries regularly to detect unauthorized access.

---

### 5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
- **Description**: Destructive SQL commands (e.g., `DROP TABLE`) render the SOE database and application unusable.
- **Impact**:
  - Operational downtime causes financial losses and disrupts dental practice workflows.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement rate-limiting to prevent excessive query execution.
  - Use database backups and recovery plans to restore functionality quickly.

---

### 6. **Elevation of Privilege**
- **Description**: Attackers escalate privileges by creating admin accounts or accessing sensitive database functions.
- **Impact**:
  - Attackers gain control over the entire SOE database, enabling further exploitation.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Enforce MFA for admin accounts.
  - Regularly audit database role assignments and permissions.
  - Monitor for unauthorized admin account creation or role changes.

## Recommendations
1. **Enforce Secure Coding Practices**:
   - Use prepared statements and input validation to prevent SQL injection.
2. **Harden the Database**:
   - Restrict permissions and apply encryption to protect sensitive data.
3. **Enable Comprehensive Monitoring**:
   - Log all database activity and set up alerts for anomalies.
4. **Educate Staff**:
   - Train developers on secure coding and database administrators on monitoring best practices.
5. **Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
   - Detect and block SQL injection attempts at the network level.
