# STRIDE Analysis for Scenario 2: Credential Theft

## Introduction
The STRIDE framework identifies and categorizes potential threats to the SOE application in the context of brute force and credential stuffing attacks. This analysis provides a detailed breakdown of each STRIDE category and its relevance to the attack scenario.

---

## Threat Categories

### 1. Spoofing
- **Description**: Attackers use stolen or brute-forced credentials to impersonate legitimate SOE users.
- **Impact**:
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive patient data.
  - Risk of operational tampering by impersonating admin users.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Enforce strong password policies.
  - Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
  - Use CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to mitigate automated attacks.

---

### 2. Tampering
- **Description**: After gaining access, attackers tamper with patient records or system configurations.
- **Impact**:
  - Incorrect or altered medical records could lead to legal liability or patient harm.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Enable file integrity monitoring on critical data and configurations.
  - Log and monitor changes to patient records.

---

### 3. Repudiation
- **Description**: Lack of sufficient logging allows attackers to deny malicious actions, such as unauthorized logins or data tampering.
- **Impact**:
  - Difficulty in performing forensic investigations and tracing actions back to attackers.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement comprehensive logging for all login attempts and system modifications.
  - Use tamper-proof logging mechanisms to ensure auditability.

---

### 4. Information Disclosure
- **Description**: Attackers use stolen credentials to access sensitive patient information stored in the SOE database.
- **Impact**:
  - Breach of privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
  - Reputational and financial damage to the organization.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
  - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit data access based on user roles.
  - Monitor and audit access logs regularly.

---

### 5. Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Description**: Automated brute force or credential stuffing attacks overwhelm the login interface, causing degraded performance or outages.
- **Impact**:
  - Disruption of SOE operations, leading to financial and reputational losses.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Deploy rate-limiting mechanisms to block excessive login attempts.
  - Implement account lockout policies after repeated failed login attempts.

---

### 6. Elevation of Privilege
- **Description**: Attackers create unauthorized admin accounts after compromising valid credentials.
- **Impact**:
  - Attackers gain full control over the SOE application, enabling further exploitation.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Monitor for unauthorized creation of privileged accounts.
  - Enforce MFA for all admin users and privileged accounts.
  - Regularly audit user roles and permissions.

---

## Recommendations
1. **Strengthen Authentication Mechanisms**:
   - Enforce strong passwords, implement MFA, and monitor for credential reuse.
2. **Enable Robust Monitoring**:
   - Log and monitor login attempts and system changes.
   - Use automated tools to detect brute force or credential stuffing attempts.
3. **Educate Users**:
   - Train SOE users on the importance of unique, complex passwords and awareness of phishing attacks.
4. **Apply Defense-in-Depth**:
   - Combine rate-limiting, CAPTCHA, and access controls with proactive monitoring to address threats effectively.
