# Inherent Risk Assessment for SOE Credential Theft Scenario

## Risk Assessment Table

| **Risk**                  | **Description**                                                                 | **Type of Data**      | **Likelihood** | **Impact**      | **Overall Rating** |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Credential Theft**      | Brute force or credential stuffing attacks exploit weak or reused passwords.    | User credentials      | High           | High            | **Critical**        |
| **Data Exfiltration**     | Attackers use compromised accounts to extract sensitive patient data.           | PII, medical records  | Medium         | Very High       | **High**            |
| **Operational Disruption**| Unauthorized access disrupts SOE's operations, impacting service delivery.      | Operational data      | Medium         | High            | **High**            |
| **Persistence**           | Attackers create admin accounts or install backdoors for long-term access.      | User credentials, PII | Medium         | High            | **High**            |
| **Compliance Violations** | Breach of patient data violates privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).        | PII, medical records  | Medium         | Very High       | **High**            |

### **Key Notes**
1. **Credential Theft**:
   - Weak or reused passwords significantly increase the likelihood of successful brute force or credential stuffing attacks.
   - This is the primary entry point for attackers in this scenario.

2. **Data Exfiltration**:
   - Once credentials are compromised, attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive patient data from the SOE database.
   - This poses a severe risk to data privacy and compliance.

3. **Operational Disruption**:
   - Attackers may disrupt SOE operations by tampering with data or locking out legitimate users.
   - This leads to service downtime and reputational damage.

4. **Persistence**:
   - Attackers establish long-term access by creating unauthorized admin accounts or deploying malware.
   - This enables repeated attacks and further data theft.

5. **Compliance Violations**:
   - Unauthorized access and data breaches violate privacy regulations, exposing the organization to fines and legal actions.
