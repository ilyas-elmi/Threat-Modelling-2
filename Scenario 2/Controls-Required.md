# Controls Required for Scenario 2: Credential Theft via Brute Force or Credential Stuffing

## Overview
To mitigate the risks associated with credential theft through brute force or credential stuffing attacks, the following controls are recommended. These measures aim to strengthen authentication, reduce exposure, and enhance monitoring of the SOE desktop application.

## Controls Required

1. **Enforce Strong Password Policies**
   - Require users to create passwords with:
     - A minimum length (e.g., 12 characters).
     - Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
   - Implement password expiration policies and restrict password reuse.

2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Enforce MFA for all user accounts, requiring a second factor (e.g., SMS, authentication apps, or hardware tokens).
   - Ensure MFA implementation covers admin and privileged accounts.

3. **Rate-Limiting and Account Lockout Mechanisms**
   - Introduce rate-limiting to block excessive login attempts from the same IP address.
   - Lock accounts temporarily after a specified number of failed login attempts.

4. **Credential Monitoring**
   - Integrate with breach monitoring services to detect compromised credentials (e.g., Have I Been Pwned API).
   - Notify users to reset their passwords if credentials are found in breach databases.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Log all login attempts, including failed and successful ones.
   - Deploy real-time monitoring tools to detect unusual login patterns, such as:
     - Login attempts from unexpected geographic locations.
     - Multiple failed login attempts from a single IP address.

6. **Endpoint Protection**
   - Deploy endpoint protection tools on desktops running SOE to detect and block malware.
   - Monitor desktops for unauthorized use of credential harvesting tools.

7. **Education and Awareness**
   - Train SOE users on:
     - The risks of credential reuse and how to create strong passwords.
     - Recognizing phishing attempts that could lead to credential theft.

8. **Use of CAPTCHA or Other Bot Mitigation Techniques**
   - Implement CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to prevent automated brute force or credential stuffing attacks on the SOE login interface.

9. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Limit access to sensitive patient data by ensuring permissions are assigned based on user roles.
   - Regularly review and update role assignments to reflect current job responsibilities.

10. **Network Traffic Analysis**
    - Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor traffic to the SOE application and backend systems.
    - Detect and block suspicious activity such as high-volume login attempts or data exfiltration.

## Implementation Notes
- Combine technical controls (e.g., MFA, rate-limiting) with user education for a holistic security approach.
- Regularly test controls to ensure effectiveness against evolving attack techniques.
- Align all measures with applicable compliance requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA.
